# Setup Env

A simple project to setup my work environment. Installs anything that is needed to start working on a fresh computer.

It uses `brew` to install most of the other apps, for example `vscode` and `git`. Also includes the configuration for some apps, like installing `oh-my-posh` along with a custom theme, for the terminal appearance.

## How to Run

Run the appropriate `make` recipe:

```
# if using mac
make mac
```
